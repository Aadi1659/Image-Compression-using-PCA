# Image Compression using PCA in Python

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that can be used to compress images. PCA transforms the original data into a lower-dimensional space by finding the directions of maximum variance in the data. These directions are called principal components and they capture most of the information in the data. By keeping only a few principal components, we can reduce the size of the data while preserving most of its features.

In this project, we will use PCA to compress images in Python. We will use the scikit-learn library to perform PCA on images and compare the original and compressed images.

The code will load an image from the data folder, perform PCA with different numbers of components, and display the original and compressed images. You can change the image name and the number of components in the model.ipynb file.
